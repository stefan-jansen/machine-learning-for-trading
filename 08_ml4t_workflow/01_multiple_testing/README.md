# The minimum backtest length and the deflated SR

Lopez de Prado and Bailey (2014) also derive a deflated SR to compute the probability that the SR is statistically significant while controlling for the inflationary effect of multiple testing, non-normal returns, and shorter sample lengths.

## Code exapmle

The script [deflated_sharpe_ratio](deflated_sharpe_ratio.py) contains the commented implementation made available by Marcos Lopez de Prado on his website.
